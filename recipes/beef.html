    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>
        This beef bourguignon recipe made with Merlot is none of my favorites
        and a take-off on the venerable French dish of beef braised in 
        Burgundy wine. Serve over mashed potatoes.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            1 (2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> pound) boneless beef chuck roast, 
            cut into 2-inch cubes
         </li>
         <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
         <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
         <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
         <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
         <li>2 tablespoons flour</li>
         <li>2 cups Merlot wine</li>
         <li>2 cups beef broth</li>
         <li>2 carrots, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
         <li>2 stalks celery, cut into <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-inch pieces</li>
         <li>4 sprigs fresh thyme</li>
         <li>1 bay leaf</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Generously season beef with salt and pepper</li>
        <li>
            Heat oil in large Dutch oven over high heat. Cook and stir beef in
            hot oil until browned on all sides, 10 to 15 minutes. Use a slotted
            spoon to transfer meat to a plate.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook and stir onion, butter, and a pinch of salt in drippings in the Dutch 
            oven until onion begins to sweat. Stir in flour; cook and stir until onion
            starts to soften, 3 t0 4 minutes. Pour in wine; bring to simmer and Cook
            until wine is reduced by half, about 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Return beef and any accumulated juices to the Dutch oven. Add both, carrots,
            celery, thyme sprigs, and bay leaf; season with salt. Bring to a simmer, cover
            the pot with a lid, and cook over low heat until meat is almost tender, about
            1 hour 30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove the lid and continue cooking at a simmer until meat is tender and
            stew is thick, about 30 minutes more. Season with salt and pepper.
        </li>
    </ol>
