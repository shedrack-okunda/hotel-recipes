        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather the ingredients</li>
            <li>
                Rinse chicken thighs and pat dry with paper towels. Heat oil in the pot
                of an electric pressure cooker on Saute mode; add chicken. Cook until
                browned, about 6 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to a plate, reserving 
                drippings in the pot.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place mushrooms, celery, and onion in the pot; cook and stir until soft, about
                5 minutes. Add garlic; cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Place chicken black
                in the pot; add tomatoes and tomato paste. Sprinkle with herbes de Provence.
                Top with water and bouillon.
            </li>
            <li>
                Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions.
                Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build. Cook for 11 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to
                manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid carefully,
                turning it away from you. Test chicken for doneness; an instant-read thermometer
                inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Season to taste with red
                pepper flakes and black pepper.
